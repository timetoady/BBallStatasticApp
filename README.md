# Stat-tastic: Basketball Stat Tracker and Roster Manager
 Stat-tastic is a full stack basketball roster app. A user is able to add, edit, and remove any number of roster players, which are persistent online via MongoDB. Once added, you can sort the players by any of those categories on the main roster page.
 
 The app is written in Node.js for the backend, with pure JavaScript (with a little bootstrap) for the frontend.
